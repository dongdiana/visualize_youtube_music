    <h2>ðŸŽµ Youtube Premium and Music</h2>
    <div class="youtube-container">
      <div class="youtube-plot" id="youtube1"></div>
      <p id="youtube_1_text">YouTube introduced a package called <strong>YouTube Premium</strong> in 2015,<br>
        which can use Youtube without advertisements and interruption.<br>

        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="youtube-container">
      <p id="youtube_2_text">One of the reason why people subscribe Youtube premium is <br>
      that they can use Youtube <strong>without interruption</strong>.<br>
      Thanks to Youtube Premium, we can listen to the videos <br>

    <h2>ðŸŽµ Global distribution of Youtube Music channels</h2>
    <br>
    <div class="text_center" id="youtube3"></div>
      <p class="text_center"> The global distribution of famous Youtube Music channels shows us<br>
        which country has higher proportion of music industry in Youtube.<br>
        For the total number of famous music channels,<br>
        <strong>United States, India, and Brazil</strong> ranked highly by this order.<br>
        What's interesting is, mean of subscribers has different rank,<br>
        <strong>South Korea, Canada, and Barbodos</strong> ranked highly by this order.<br><br>
        We can say United States has a big music industry in Youtube,<br>
        but also South Korea has a big power in Youtube music industry. <br><br>
      </p>
    <div class="text_center" id="youtube4"></div>
      <p id="italic-text"><br><br>(You can use slider by dragging the scatter plot and filter by clicking the bar chart.)<br></p>
      <p class="text_center"> The scatter plot of views of video, subscribers,<br>
        and uploaded videos of music channel by country shows us<br>
        what is the characteristics of famous Youtube music channels.<br>
        In general, <strong>the higher views</strong> of videos has <strong>more subscribers</strong>,<br>
        especially we can see it clearly with the India case.<br>
        But there are a lot of channels with <strong>small uploaded videos</strong><br>
        even though they have high views and subscribers.<br><br>
        This can be explained by characteristics of Youtube music channels,<br>
        because people continuously play music with Youtube<br>
        though that channel has fewer uploads than other channel like News or Blog.<br><br><br>
      </p>
    <h2>ðŸŽµ What about earnings?</h2>
    <div class="text_center" id="youtube5"></div>
      <p class="text_center">Fianlly, let's talk about money.<br>
        When we see Top 10 Music channels' lowest and highest<br>
        monthly earnings, we can notice some interesting points.<br>
        Top 1 channel - T-series - has similar highest earnings<br>
        with lowest earnings of top 6 channel - BangtanTV.<br><br>
        Like this, there are <strong>big difference in earnings</strong> between music channels<br>
        and a lot of channnels has low "lowest-earnings" because it's music channels.<br>
        Music channels always have copy right issue<br>
        and it usually prevents the way to make money.</p>
